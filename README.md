## Our Story 💙

Meet Nate :) our sweet, funny, and incredibly strong little man. In just two short months of life, he's already touched more hearts than we can count. Nate is truly the best thing that's ever happened to our family - his smile lights up every room, and his spirit is inspiring.

Nate was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor, and since then, he's shown more bravery than most do in a lifetime. His journey has included surgeries, treatments, and long days in the hospital, but through it all, he's remained the strongest little fighter.

We are endlessly grateful for the incredible care team at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia- from Neurosurgeons and Oncologists to radiologists, nurses, ICU & ED doctors, respiratory therapists, Speech & Occupational Therapists, chaplains, child life specialists, and social workers- every single one has played a role in supporting Nate and helping our family through the unimaginable.

While Nate still has a long road ahead, he is doing well, and we're so proud of him every single day. Any donation, big or small, helps. Thank you for supporting Nate the Great and the incredible work being done at CHOP.

## Why This Matters 🎯

**PATIENTS NEED US:** Parents shouldn't have to hear the words "your child has cancer," but 1 in 285 children in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer by the time they are 20 years old.

**BREAKTHROUGHS ARE UPON US:** Every day, CHOP's Cancer Center team is redefining what a cancer diagnosis means for a child. The center offers the most advanced therapies available anywhere in the world, including cutting-edge clinical trials that reprogram the body's own immune system to fight cancer. CHOP's Center for Childhood Cancer Research is one of the most distinguished research programs in the nation.

## How You Can Help 🤝

**MAKE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT TODAY:** 100% of every donation to the Parkway Run & Walk, presented by Citadel, will help CHOP make important breakthroughs in understanding the causes of childhood cancer, developing new treatments that will improve outcomes for children, and one day may lead to a cure for childhood cancer.
